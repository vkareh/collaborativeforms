# CollaborativeForms

_CollaborativeForms_ is a web-based free software platform for data collection. It is used for collecting data securely across multiple groups and locations and provide intuitive break-down of the data, as well as raw data exports.

_CollaborativeForms_ is built on top of [Drupal](http://drupal.org) to provide a robust and extensible solution that will work for many data collection purposes.

To install, run `drush make collaborativeforms.make SITE_NAME`, where SITE\_NAME is the name of your site. If you don't have Drush installed, follow the instructions on the [Drush project page](http://drupal.org/project/drush)
